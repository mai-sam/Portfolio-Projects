      <h2>Statue of Liberty</h2>
      <p>The Statue of Liberty was a gift given to us by the French in 1886 and is was to greet immigrants that came to New York as a symbol of freedom. However, if architecture isn't your thing, in order to get to the Statue of Liberty you get on a ferry
        to reach the 14 acre island known as Liberty Island. The view from the ferry ride of New York is breathtaking. The ferry also drops you off at Ellis Island where millions of immigrants embarked on their American Dream, Ellis Island is now home
        to the Immigration Muesuem. Technically you can see The Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island for free, however, you have to buy a ferry ticket which is usually 20 dollars. Visiting the Statue of Liberty is an activity that any age can enjoy. </p>

      <h2>Times Square</h2>
