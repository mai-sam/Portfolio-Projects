    <p>If you're looking for new delicacies to hunt, consider the fact that just about every neighborhood in New York City has something to offer, by way of their food scenes. The city is one big melting pot and its food scene a catalog of foods new, classic,
      and globally inspired.</p>

      <h2>Halal Guys Food Truck</h2>
      <p>In New York you can see a food truck on every corner of every street, you can close your eyes and walk ten feet and you'll run into one, but the single diamond that stands out among all of them is the Halal Guy's food truck! It can be considered
        a "New" New York classic. For only $10 dollars you get a combo platter consisting of chicken and beef gyro over rice. If you want something more handheld you can order a pita gyro. Even if it's considered street food, it won't always be so quick.
        They can have a line that wraps around a block during peak lunch hours. But when you get to the front of the line make sure to ask for extra red and white sauce and they only accept cash, but don't worry, there's always an ATM around the corner.</p>
